Automatic hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian Optimization

Dataset: Fashion MNIST

1. use BO software to perform hyper-parameter search for Bagging and Boosting classifiers: two
hyper-parameters (size of ensemble and depth of decision tree).

2. employ Bayesian Optimization (BO) software to automate the search for the best
hyper-parameters by running it for 50 iterations.
